Judas was the twelfth apostle who walked beside Jesus Christ for three years and then betrayed him for thirty silver coins, which would be about 500 euros with inflation today. His name has always become a symbol of betrayal and humiliation.

Life is about the fact that it can teach us an important lesson in life, that it is possible to walk around the table all your life and, despite it, have a hard heart, that we can have information about God and at the same time not know God at all.

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:05,120
The information about God is just like a notebook. If you can not read them, they are nothing to you.

4
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:18,900
You can know who King David was or what the twelfth apostles were called. You can know the names of the commandments and spells and know the correct answer to all the obstacles in your faith.

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:29,739
You can regularly visit the church and be able to analyze the punishment well and, despite that, God can be completely separated from you.

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:50,079
Faith in God means getting a gift to hear music. It means giving up your heart to God and allowing him to enter. When you do that, the note mark will come alive and the notes will start giving you meaning.

00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:16,159
I wish you, who are watching this video, that your heart could be soft and that even you could hear God's voice today. I wish you a gift to hear music.

Thank you for watching!
