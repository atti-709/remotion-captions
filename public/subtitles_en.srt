00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,339
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a Swiss psychologist who devoted her whole life to patients on the brink of death, once said this.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:19,000
The most beautiful people I know are those who have experienced suffering, loss, fight and defeat, and who found their way out of their bottom.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,899
These people have gratitude, sensitivity and understanding for life, which they fill with compassion, gentleness and deep love full of interest.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,619
Beautiful people don't just appear like that.

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,380
If you are in the middle of a difficult period of life, this song is dedicated to you.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,479
I found the way out of the depth, richer for paying the cost, of having a dream disappear, of finding a hope that will last.

7
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,180
Beautiful people don't happen overnight.

8
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,859
I found the way out of the depth, richer for paying the cost, of having a dream disappear, of finding a hope that will last.
 
9
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:28,200
I found the way out of the depth, richer for paying the cost, of having a dream disappear, of finding a hope that will last.

10
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:37,420
I found the way out of the depth, richer for paying the cost, of having a dream disappear, of having a dream disappear.

11
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,420
I didn't know how to forgive, things that I couldn't forget.

12
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,840
I wasn't ready to change, I hadn't felt love yet.

13
00:01:50,920 --> 00:02:03,140
My self-righteousness was a wall, so when it came falling apart, freedom was found in the breaking of my heart.

14
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:16,759
I believe there is a place where we are fully who we were always meant to be.

15
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:27,139
How it happens, all I know is that no one gets there on a rainy street.

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:44,000
So if it feels like you're losing again and again, not one minute is wasted of that pain.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I believe there is a place where we are fully who we were always meant to be.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,379
Kind and gracious, forgiving and patient, with compassion for the wounded and the weak.

19
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:27,520
How it happens, all I know is that no one gets there on a rainy street.

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:36,520
No one gets there on a rainy street.
