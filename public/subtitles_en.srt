00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,339
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a Swiss psychologist who devoted her life to patients on the brink of death, once said this.

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:19,000
The most beautiful people I know are those who have experienced suffering, loss, fight and defeat, and who found their way out of their bottom.

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:30,899
These people have gratitude, sensitivity and understanding for life, which they fill with feeling and gentleness and deep love full of interest.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,060
Beautiful people do not act just like that.

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,399
If you are in the middle of a difficult period of life, this song is now dedicated to you.

6
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,000
The most beautiful people I know have suffered immeasurable loss

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Then found their way out of the depths - richer for paying the cost

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,560
Of having a dream disappear or finding a hope paralyzed

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,900
Beautiful people don't happen

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:15,760
Overnight. I believe there is a place where

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,200
We are fully who we were always meant to be

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,219
How it happens? All I know is

13
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,500
No one gets there on a winning streak

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,140
I didn't know how to forgive

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,299
The things that I couldn't forget

16
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:50,500
I wasn't ready to change - I hadn't failed enough yet

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,099
My self-righteousness was a wall and when it came falling apart

18
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:03,219
Freedom was found in the breaking of my heart

19
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:09,919
I believe there is a place where

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,699
We are fully who we were always meant to be

21
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:22,800
How it happens? All I know is

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,400
No one gets there on a winning streak

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,080
If it feels like you're losing

24
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,659
Again and again

25
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:44,500
Not one minute is wasted of that pain

26
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:53,159
I believe there is a place where

27
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,659
We are fully who we were always meant to be

28
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:07,800
Kind and gracious, forgiving and patient

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,400
With compassion for the wounded and the weak

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,740
How it happens? All I know is

31
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,419
No one gets there on a winning streak

32
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:37,879
No one gets there on a winning streak
